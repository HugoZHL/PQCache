It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives,\nbecause that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years. They run programs in\nhospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of\ntheir babies once they get home. They're in 165 hospitals now. And\nbecause they know the numbers before and after they start at a new\nhospital, they can measure the impact they have. It is massive.\nFor every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.This number comes from a study\nof 133,733 families at 28 different\nhospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better\nBirth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems\ninnovation at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan\nSchool of Public Health.Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the\nmost conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number\nof lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen.\n$1,235.For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how\nthis specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number\nof lives saved as a result.NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially\nnew, but I'm excited about its potential. And I'm excited to see\nwhat happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT\nrepresenting something that has already happened,\nthis NFT gets better as the price gets higher.The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it\ntakes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save\n2000 lives. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more\nlives will be saved. What a sentence to be able to write.August 2021When people say that in their experience all programming languages\nare basically equivalent, they're making a statement not about\nlanguages but about the kind of programming they've done.99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library\nfunctions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one\ncan easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection\nof popular programming languages.But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.\nIf you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird\nlanguages is a good clue to follow.Weird languages aren't weird by accident. Not the good ones, at\nleast. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence\nof some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together\nof library calls.A concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to\nmany Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of\npopular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement\nproperly in a language without turning it into a dialect of\nLisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go\nbeyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first\nwriting a language for problems of that type, and then writing\nyour specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with\nmacros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating\ntechniques that even now is far from fully explored.So if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be,\none way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language\nthat most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart,\nand then focus on the differences between this language and the\nintersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language\nthat would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the\nprocess of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say,\nyou'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't\npreviously think.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Amjad\nMasad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.\nJanuary 2015Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companies\nthat buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp\ndev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not.It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to\nsell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to\nget an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startups\nshould only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well\nor really badly.  If you're doing really badly, meaning the company\nis about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have\nnothing to lose. And if you're doing really well, you can safely\ntalk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,\nand if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll\nbe confident enough to tell them to get lost.The danger is to companies in the middle.  Particularly to young\ncompanies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long\nenough to have grown big yet.  It's usually a mistake for a promising\ncompany less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.But it's a mistake founders constantly make.  When someone from\ncorp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should\nat least find out what they want.  Besides, they don't want to\noffend Big Company by refusing to meet.Well, I'll tell you what they want.  They want to talk about buying\nyou.  That's what the title \"corp dev\" means.   So before agreeing\nto meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, \"Do we want to\nsell the company right now?\"  And if the answer is no, tell them\n\"Sorry, but we're focusing on growing the company.\"  They won't be\noffended.  And certainly the founders of Big Company won't be\noffended. If anything they'll think more highly of you.  You'll\nremind them of themselves.  They didn't sell either; that's why\nthey're in a position now to buy other companies.\n[1]Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it\nmeans.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know\nthey don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  Why do they do it?\nThe same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most\nmistakes founders make. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants\nto buy you.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly\nhigh.  You should at least see what it is, right?No.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,\nsure, you might as well open it.  But that is not how conversations\nwith corp dev work.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the\nend of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And if the\noffer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  And\nconversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction,\nbecause as well as consuming your attention they undermine your\nmorale.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not\nto stop and think how tired you are.  Instead you get into a sort\nof flow. \n[2]\nImagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a\nmarathon, someone ran up beside you and said \"You must feel really\ntired.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?\"  Conversations\nwith corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of\nstopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price\nyou think they'll offer.And then you're really in trouble.  If they can, corp dev people\nlike to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the point\nwhere you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying\nto convince you to sell.  And surprisingly often they succeed.This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful\nforces that can work on founders' minds, and attended by an experienced\nprofessional whose full time job is to push you down it.Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly\nbrutal. Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they\ndon't even get to choose which.  The only way their performance is\nmeasured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious\nones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they'll\nalmost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll\ntake it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you\nand make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait till\nyou've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then\nthey come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do\nit for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time.\nIf you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to\nwhat corp dev people can do.  Even corp dev people at companies\nthat are otherwise benevolent.I remember once complaining to a\nfriend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people had\npulled on a YC startup.\"What happened to Don't be Evil?\" I asked.\"I don't think corp dev got the memo,\" he replied.The tactics you encounter in M&A conversations can be like nothing\nyou've experienced in the otherwise comparatively \nupstanding world\nof Silicon Valley.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the\nold-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the\nstartup world.\n[3]The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John\nD. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect\nhimself from becoming one.  He once told a Sunday school class\n\n  Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never\n  took the first drink.\n\nDo you want to sell your company right now?  Not eventually, right\nnow.  If not, just don't take the first meeting.  They won't be\noffended.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of\nthe worst experiences that can happen to a startup.If you do want to sell, there's another set of \ntechniques\n for doing\nthat.  But the biggest mistake founders make in dealing with corp\ndev is not doing a bad job of talking to them when they're ready\nto, but talking to them before they are.  So if you remember only\nthe title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to\nknow about M&A in the first year.Notes[1]\nI'm not saying you should never sell.  I'm saying you should\nbe clear in your own mind about whether you want to sell or not,\nand not be led by manipulation or wishful thinking into trying to\nsell earlier than you otherwise would have.[2]\nIn a startup, as in most competitive sports, the task at hand\nalmost does this for you; you're too busy to feel tired.  But when\nyou lose that protection, e.g. at the final whistle, the fatigue\nhits you like a wave.  To talk to corp dev is to let yourself feel\nit mid-game.[3]\nTo be fair, the apparent misdeeds of corp dev people are magnified\nby the fact that they function as the face of a large organization\nthat often doesn't know its own mind.  Acquirers can be surprisingly\nindecisive about acquisitions, and their flakiness is indistinguishable\nfrom dishonesty by the time it filters down to you.Thanks to Marc Andreessen, Jessica Livingston, Geoff\nRalston, and Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2008, rev. June 2008Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Our bodies\nweren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or\nto get so little exercise.  \nThere may be a similar problem with the way we work: \na normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour\nor sugar is for us physically.I began to suspect this after spending several years working \nwith startup founders.  I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've\nnoticed a definite difference between programmers working on their\nown startups and those working for large organizations.\nI wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily;\nstarting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put\nit is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is\nhappier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating\ndoughnuts.Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be\nworking in a way that's more natural for humans.I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that\nI'd only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they\nseemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times\nmore alive. They're like different animals. I suspect that working\nfor oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living\nin the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.\nLife in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed\nfor.\nTreesWhat's so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root of\nthe problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large\ngroups.Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that\neach species thrives in groups of a certain size.  A herd of impalas\nmight have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  Humans\nalso seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about\nhunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own\nexperience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8\nwork well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50\nis really unwieldy.\n[1]\nWhatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in\ngroups of several hundred.  And yet—for reasons having more\nto do with technology than human nature—a great many people\nwork for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide\nthemselves into units small enough to work together.  But to\ncoordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Your\nboss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  But when\nyou use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,\nsomething strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention\nexplicitly.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss\nrepresents your entire group.  A group of 10 managers is not merely\na group of 10 people working together in the usual way.  It's really\na group of groups.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work\ntogether as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group\nworking for each manager would have to work as if they were a single\nperson—the workers and manager would each share only one\nperson's worth of freedom between them.In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were\none person.  But in a large organization divided into groups in\nthis way, the pressure is always in that direction.  Each group\ntries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals\nthat humans were designed to work in.  That was the point of creating\nit.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that\neach person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the\nsize of the entire tree.\n[2]Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this.  You\ncan feel the difference between working for a company with 100\nemployees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.\nCorn SyrupA group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake\ntribe.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  But\nsomething is missing: individual initiative.  Tribes of hunter-gatherers\nhave much more freedom.  The leaders have a little more power than other\nmembers of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to\ndo and when the way a boss can.It's not your boss's fault.  The real problem is that in the group\nabove you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.\nYour boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels\nboth right and wrong at the same time.   On the surface it feels\nlike the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major\nis missing.  A job at a big company is like high fructose corn\nsyrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like,\nbut is disastrously lacking in others.Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with\nthe usual sort of job.For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do,\nat least for programmers.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows\nthat pretty clearly.  If you were dropped at a random point in\nAmerica today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.\nHumans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high\nfructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  And yet if\nyou analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably\nfind these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories.\n\"Normal\" food is terribly bad for you.  The only people who eat\nwhat humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing\nweirdos in Berkeley.If \"normal\" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There are\ntwo main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal.  You\nmay feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first\ncouple bites feels great.  The other is economies of scale.\nProducing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't.\nWhich means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth\nspending a lot to market it.If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily\nmarketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's\nexpensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you\nthink most will choose?It's the same with work.  The average MIT graduate wants to work\nat Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe,\nand they'll get paid a good salary right away.  It's the job\nequivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  The drawbacks will\nonly become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of\nmalaise.And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like\nthe Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minority\nof the population, they're the ones living as humans are meant to.\nIn an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.\nProgrammersThe restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on\nprogrammers, because the essence of programming is to build new\nthings.  Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support\npeople answer much the same questions; but once you've written a\npiece of code you don't need to write it again.  So a programmer\nworking as programmers are meant to is always making new things.\nAnd when you're part of an organization whose structure gives each\nperson freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you're\ngoing to face resistance when you do something new.This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness.  It's true even\nin the smartest companies.  I was talking recently to a founder who\nconsidered starting a startup right out of college, but went to\nwork for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there.\nHe didn't learn as much as he expected.  Programmers learn by doing,\nand most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn't—sometimes\nbecause the company wouldn't let him, but often because the company's\ncode wouldn't let him.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead\nof doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions\nimposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a\nfraction of the things he would have liked to.  He said he has\nlearned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has\nto do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at\nleast when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  If you're not allowed\nto implement new ideas, you stop having them.  And vice versa: when\nyou can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.\nSo working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same\nway a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of\ncourse.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big\ncompany and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing\nthe startup.You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size\nof company you work for.  If you start the company, you'll have the\nmost freedom.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll\nhave almost as much freedom as the founders.  Even a company with\n100 people will feel different from one with 1000.Working for a small company doesn't ensure freedom.  The tree\nstructure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom,\nnot a lower bound.  The head of a small company may still choose\nto be a tyrant.  The point is that a large organization is compelled\nby its structure to be one.\nConsequencesThat has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.\nOne is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger,\nno matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.  It's a\nconsequence of the tree structure that every large organization is\nforced to adopt.Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if\nthey avoided tree structure.  And since human nature limits the\nsize of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine\nfor larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no\nstructure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work\ntogether the way components of a market economy do.That might be worth exploring.  I suspect there are already some\nhighly partitionable businesses that lean this way.  But I don't\nknow any technology companies that have done it.There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves\nas sponges:  they can stay small.  If I'm right, then it really\npays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.\nParticularly a technology company.  Which means it's doubly important\nto hire the best people.  Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get\nless done, but they also make you big, because you need more of\nthem to solve a given problem.For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.  It will always\nsuck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization,\nthe more it will suck.In an essay I wrote a couple years ago \nI advised graduating seniors\nto work for a couple years for another company before starting their\nown.  I'd modify that now.  Work for another company if you want\nto, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own\nstartup, go ahead.The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately\nwas that I felt most would fail.  And they will.  But ambitious\nprogrammers are better off doing their own thing and failing than\ngoing to work at a big company.  Certainly they'll learn more.  They\nmight even be better off financially.  A lot of people in their\nearly twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even\nfaster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.\nAt least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be\nzero rather than negative.  \n[3]We've now funded so many different types of founders that we have\nenough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from\nworking for a big company.  The people who've worked for a few years\ndo seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only\nbecause they're that much older.The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of\nconservative.  It's hard to say how much is because big companies\nmade them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that\nmade them work for the big companies in the first place.  But\ncertainly a large part of it is learned.  I know because I've seen\nit burn off.Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that\nconvinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small\ngroup, is the natural way for programmers to live.  Founders arriving\nat Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.  Three\nmonths later they're transformed: they have so much more \nconfidence\nthat they seem as if they've grown several inches taller. \n[4]\nStrange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the same\ntime.  Which is exactly how I'd describe the way lions seem in the\nwild.Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear\nthat the difference between the two is due mostly to environment—and\nin particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to\nprogrammers.   In the first couple weeks of working on their own\nstartup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working\nthe way people are meant to.Notes[1]\nWhen I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a\ncertain way, I mean by evolution.[2]\nIt's not only the leaves who suffer.  The constraint propagates\nup as well as down.  So managers are constrained too; instead of\njust doing things, they have to act through subordinates.[3]\nDo not finance your startup with credit cards.  Financing a\nstartup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt\nstupidest of all.  Credit card debt is a bad idea, period.  It is\na trap set by evil companies for the desperate and the foolish.[4]\nThe founders we fund used to be younger (initially we encouraged\nundergrads to apply), and the first couple times I saw this I used\nto wonder if they were actually getting physically taller.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Ross Boucher, Aaron Iba, Abby\nKirigin, Ivan Kirigin, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for\nreading drafts of this.\n\nApril 2009I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one.  The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for startup founders.The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies.  Each year.  They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded.  In fact they'd cause there to be \nmore jobs for Americans, because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew.The tricky part might seem to be how one defined a startup. But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.  Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.  The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.How would the government decide who's a startup investor?  The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas. We'll establish our own accreditation procedure. We know who one another are.10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards, but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders.  I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous.  The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jeff Clavier, David Hornik, Jessica Livingston, Greg Mcadoo, Aydin Senkut, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.Related:April 2004To the popular press, \"hacker\" means someone who breaks\ninto computers.  Among programmers it means a good programmer.\nBut the two meanings are connected.  To programmers,\n\"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone\nwho can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer\nwants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses.  It can\nbe either a compliment or an insult.  It's called a hack when\nyou do something in an ugly way.  But when you do something\nso clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also\ncalled a hack.  The word is used more often in the former than\nthe latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more\ncommon than brilliant ones.Believe it or not, the two senses of \"hack\" are also\nconnected.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in\ncommon: they both break the rules.  And there is a gradual\ncontinuum between rule breaking that's merely ugly (using\nduct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking\nthat is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).Hacking predates computers.  When he\nwas working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to\namuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.\nThis tradition continues today.\nWhen we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much\ntime around MIT had\nhis own lock picking kit.\n(He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would\nwant to do such things.\nAnother friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for\nbreaking into computers.  This had only recently been declared\na crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative\ntechnique didn't work.  Police investigation apparently begins with\na motive.  The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex,\nrevenge.  Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on\nthe FBI's list.  Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to\nthem.Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers'\ngeneral attitude of disobedience.  But that disobedience is\na byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.\nThey may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate\nnewspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them\na certain problem can't be solved.\nSuppress one, and you suppress the other.This attitude is sometimes affected.  Sometimes young programmers\nnotice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to\nadopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.\nThe fake version is not merely\nannoying; the prickly attitude of these posers\ncan actually slow the process of innovation.But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities,\nthe disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win.  I wish its\nadvantages were better understood.For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are\nsimply mystified by\nhackers' attitudes toward copyrights.  They are a perennial\ntopic of heated discussion on Slashdot.\nBut why should people who program computers\nbe so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent\ncopying.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is\nhow to pick it.  But there is a deeper reason that\nhackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.\nThey see increasingly aggressive measures to protect\n\"intellectual property\"\nas a threat to the intellectual\nfreedom they need to do their job.\nAnd they are right.It is by poking about inside current technology that\nhackers get ideas for the next generation.  No thanks,\nintellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any\noutside help.  But they're wrong.\nThe next generation of computer technology has\noften—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing\nwhat they expected to be\nthe next generation of business computer.  They were mistaken.\nThe next generation of business computer was\nbeing developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired\nguys called Steve in a garage in Los Altos.  At about the\nsame time, the powers that be\nwere cooperating to develop the\nofficial next generation operating system, Multics.\nBut two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off\nand wrote their own.  They gave it a name that\nwas a joking reference to Multics: Unix.The latest intellectual property laws impose\nunprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that\nleads to new ideas. In the past, a competitor might use patents\nto prevent you from selling a copy of something they\nmade, but they couldn't prevent you from\ntaking one apart to see how it worked.   The latest\nlaws make this a crime.  How are we\nto develop new technology if we can't study current\ntechnology to figure out how to improve it?Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves.\nComputers are responsible for the problem.  The control systems\ninside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.\nIncreasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is\nin software. And by this I mean software in the general sense:\ni.e. data.  A song on an LP is physically stamped into the\nplastic.  A song on an iPod's disk is merely stored on it.Data is by definition easy to copy.  And the Internet\nmakes copies easy to distribute.  So it is no wonder\ncompanies are afraid.  But, as so often happens, fear has\nclouded their judgement.  The government has responded\nwith draconian laws to protect intellectual property.\nThey probably mean well. But\nthey may not realize that such laws will do more harm\nthan good.Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws?\nIf I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this\nmystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly\nheard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night,\nI'd want to go out and investigate.  Hackers are not stupid,\nand unanimity is very rare in this world.\nSo if they're all squawking,   \nperhaps there is something amiss.Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America,\nwill actually harm it?  Think about it.  There is something\nvery American about Feynman breaking into safes during\nthe Manhattan Project.  It's hard to imagine the authorities\nhaving a sense of humor about such things over\nin Germany at that time.  Maybe it's not a coincidence.Hackers are unruly.  That is the essence of hacking.  And it\nis also the essence of Americanness.  It is no accident\nthat Silicon Valley\nis in America, and not France, or Germany,\nor England, or Japan. In those countries, people color inside\nthe lines.I lived for a while in Florence.  But after I'd been there\na few months I realized that what I'd been unconsciously hoping\nto find there was back in the place I'd just left.\nThe reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.\nIn 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious\npeople you find now in America.  (So I went back to America.)It is greatly to America's advantage that it is\na congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—that\nit is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.\nAnd hackers are invariably smart-alecks.  If we had a national\nholiday, it would be April 1st.  It says a great deal about\nour work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a\nhorribly cheesy solution.   When we cook one up we're not\nalways 100% sure which kind it is.  But as long as it has\nthe right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign.\nIt's odd that people\nthink of programming as precise and methodical.  Computers\nare precise and methodical.  Hacking is something you do\nwith a gleeful laugh.In our world some of the most characteristic solutions\nare not far removed from practical\njokes.  IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the consequences\nof the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical\n\"adversary\" must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem by\nredefining it as one that's easier to solve.Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much they\ncan get away with.  And lately hackers \nhave sensed a change\nin the atmosphere.\nLately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seems\nespecially ominous.  That must also mystify outsiders. \nWhy should we care especially about civil\nliberties?  Why programmers, more than\ndentists or salesmen or landscapers?Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.\nCivil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint\nAmerican tradition.  Civil liberties make countries rich.\nIf you made a graph of\nGNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you'd notice a definite\ntrend.  Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather\nthan just an effect?  I think so.  I think a society in which\npeople can do and say what they want will also tend to\nbe one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than\nthose sponsored by the most influential people.\nAuthoritarian countries become corrupt;\ncorrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. \nIt seems to me there is\na Laffer curve for government power, just as for\ntax revenues.  At least, it seems likely enough that it\nwould be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  Unlike\nhigh tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it\nturns out to be a mistake.This is why hackers worry.  The government spying on people doesn't\nliterally make programmers write worse code.  It just leads\neventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  And because\nthis is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive\nto it.  They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a\ndistance, as animals can sense an approaching  \nthunderstorm.It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures\nintended to protect national security and intellectual property\nturned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes   \nAmerica successful.  But it would not be the first time that\nmeasures taken in an atmosphere of panic had\nthe opposite of the intended effect.There is such a thing as Americanness.\nThere's nothing like living abroad to teach you that.   \nAnd if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash\nthis quality, it would be hard to find a better focus\ngroup than hackers, because they come closest of any group\nI know to embodying it.  Closer, probably,  than\nthe men running our government,\nwho for all their talk of patriotism\nremind me more of Richelieu or Mazarin\nthan Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.When you read what the founding fathers had to say for\nthemselves, they sound more like hackers.\n\"The spirit of resistance to government,\"\nJefferson wrote, \"is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish\nit always to be kept alive.\"Imagine an American president saying that today.\nLike the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of\nthe founding fathers have embarrassed generations of\ntheir less confident successors.  They remind us where we come from.\nThey remind us that it is the people who break rules that are\nthe source of America's wealth and power.Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be\nobeyed.  But be careful what you ask for. You might get it.Thanks to Ken Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Giffin, \nSarah Harlin,  Shiro Kawai, Jessica Livingston, Matz, \nJackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Eric Raymond, Guido van Rossum,\nDavid Weinberger, and\nSteven Wolfram for reading drafts of this essay.\n(The image shows Steves Jobs and Wozniak \nwith a \"blue box.\"\nPhoto by Margret Wozniak. Reproduced by permission of Steve\nWozniak.)January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300\/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300\/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb\/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.May 2004When people care enough about something to do it well, those who\ndo it best tend to be far better than everyone else.  There's a\nhuge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like\nBorgognone.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the\naverage writer of detective novels.  A top-ranked professional chess\nplayer could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player\nwithout losing once.Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very\nspecialized skill.   But for some reason we treat this skill\ndifferently.  No one complains when a few people surpass all the\nrest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make\nmore money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.Why?  The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other\nskill.  What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is\nmaking money?I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:\nthe misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable\nway in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and\nthe worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for\nsociety.  As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second\noutdated, and the third empirically false.  Could it be that, in a\nmodern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?The Daddy Model of WealthWhen I was five I thought electricity was created by electric\nsockets.  I didn't realize there were power plants out there\ngenerating it.  Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth\nis something that has to be generated.  It seems to be something\nthat flows from parents.Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children\ntend to misunderstand wealth.  They confuse it with money.  They\nthink that there is a fixed amount of it.  And they think of it as\nsomething that's distributed by authorities (and so should be\ndistributed equally), rather than something that has to be created\n(and might be created unequally).In fact, wealth is not money.  Money is just a convenient way of\ntrading one form of wealth for another.  Wealth is the underlying\nstuff—the goods and services we buy.  When you travel to a\nrich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank\naccounts to tell which kind you're in.  You can see\nwealth—in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health\nof the people.Where does wealth come from?  People make it.  This was easier to\ngrasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things\nthey wanted with their own hands.  Then you could see in the house,\nthe herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  It\nwas obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed\nquantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie.  If you\nwanted more wealth, you could make it.This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly\nfor ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).  Mostly\nwe create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we\nthen trade for the forms of wealth we want. \n[1]Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has\nto be given to them.  And when wealth is something you're given,\nthen of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.\n[2]\nAs in most families it is.  The kids see to that.  \"Unfair,\" they\ncry, when one sibling gets more than another.In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents.  If you\nwant something, you either have to make it, or do something of\nequivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you\nenough money to buy it.  In the real world, wealth is (except for\na few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have\nto create, not something that's distributed by Daddy.  And since\nthe ability and desire to create it vary from person to person,\nit's not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those\nwho make more money are often simply better at doing what people\nwant.  Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.  The\nB-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go\nto the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they want\nthat extra oomph that the big stars have.Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.\nYou could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.\nSuch tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for\nsome of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root\ncause of variation in income.  The root cause of variation in income,\nas Occam's Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation\nin every other human skill.In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about\n100 times as much as the average person. \n[3]\nBasketball players\nmake about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much.\nEditorials quote this kind of statistic with horror.  But I have\nno trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive\nas another.  In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by\na factor of 50 depending on their skills. \n[4]\nAnd that's without\nconsidering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that\nyou can get from modern technology.Editorials about athletes' or CEOs' salaries remind me of early\nChristian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the\nEarth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.\n[5]\nHow much someone's work is worth is not a policy question.  It's\nsomething the market already determines.\"Are they really worth 100 of us?\" editorialists ask.  Depends on\nwhat you mean by worth.  If you mean worth in the sense of what\npeople will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.A few CEOs' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing.  But are there\nnot others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate?\nSteve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline.  And not\nmerely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs;\nhe had to decide what Apple's next products should be.  Few others\ncould have done it.  And regardless of the case with CEOs, it's\nhard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional\nbasketball players don't reflect supply and demand.It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really\ngenerate so much more wealth than another.  The key to this mystery\nis to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us?\nWould a basketball team trade one of their players for 100\nrandom people?  What would Apple's next product look like if you\nreplaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people? \n[6]\nThese\nthings don't scale linearly.  Perhaps the CEO or the professional\nathlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and\ndetermination of an ordinary person.  But it makes all the difference\nthat it's concentrated in one individual.When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid,\nwhat are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determined\nby what buyers want.  People like baseball more than  poetry, so\nbaseball players make more than poets.  To say that a certain kind\nof work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want\nthe wrong things.Well, of course people want the wrong things.  It seems odd to be\nsurprised by that.  And it seems even odder to say that it's\nunjust that certain kinds of work are underpaid. \n[7]\nThen\nyou're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things.\nIt's  lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to\nShakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust?  That seems like\nsaying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.The appearance of the word \"unjust\" here is the unmistakable spectral\nsignature of the Daddy Model.  Why else would this idea occur in\nthis odd context?  Whereas if the speaker were still operating on\nthe Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from a\ncommon source and had to be shared out, rather than something\ngenerated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly what\nyou'd get on noticing that some people made much more than others.When we talk about \"unequal distribution of income,\" we should\nalso ask, where does that income come from?\n[8]\nWho made the wealth\nit represents?  Because to the extent that income varies simply\naccording to how much wealth people create, the distribution may\nbe unequal, but it's hardly unjust.Stealing ItThe second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth\nalarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate\na fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding;\nin agricultural societies by appropriating others' estates in times\nof war, and taxing them in times of peace.In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates\nconfiscated from the losers.  In England in the 1060s, when William\nthe Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon\nnobles to his followers, the conflict was military.  By the 1530s,\nwhen Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his\nfollowers, it was mostly political. \n[9]\nBut the principle was the\nsame.  Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials\nused taxation instead of confiscation.  But here too we see the\nsame principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but\nto serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class.\nNow we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor\npoor, but originally they were a distinct group.  In a feudal\nsociety, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the\nserfs who work their estates.  The middle class were a new, third\ngroup who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing\nand trade.Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and\nformer serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful\nenough to ignore the local feudal lords. \n[10]\nLike serfs, the middle\nclass made a living largely by creating wealth.  (In port cities\nlike Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs\nthey had an incentive to create a lot of it.  Any wealth a serf\ncreated belonged to his master.  There was not much point in making\nmore than you could hide.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen\nallowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as\na whole started to get richer very rapidly.  Nearly everything we\nhave was created by the middle class.  Indeed, the other two classes\nhave effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their\nnames been given to either end of the middle class.  (In the original\nsense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation\ndefinitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich.  In\nEngland, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in\nfact only started to be called \"corruption\") when there started to\nbe other, faster ways to get rich.Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today,\nin that government office was a recognized route to wealth.  The\ngreat fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would\nnow call corruption than from commerce. \n[11]\nBy the nineteenth\ncentury that had changed.  There continued to be bribes, as there\nstill are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men who\nwere driven more by vanity than greed.  Technology had made it\npossible to create wealth faster than you could steal it.  The\nprototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier\nbut an industrialist.With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum\ngame.  Jobs and Wozniak didn't have to make us poor to make themselves\nrich.  Quite the opposite: they created things that made our lives\nmaterially richer.  They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth\nwas to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  Idealistic\nundergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child's model of\nwealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past.  It is a case of\nthe mistaken meeting the outdated.\"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,\" Balzac wrote.  Except\nhe didn't.  What he actually said was that a great fortune with no\napparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed\nthat it had been forgotten.  If we were talking about Europe in\n1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation\nwould be spot on.  But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France,\nwhere the Industrial Revolution was well advanced.  He knew you\ncould make a fortune without stealing it.  After all, he did himself,\nas a popular novelist.\n[12]Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have\nreached this stage.  In most, corruption still has the upper hand.\nIn most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.  And so\nwhen we see increasing differences in income in a rich country,\nthere is a tendency to worry that it's sliding back toward becoming\nanother Venezuela.  I think the opposite is happening. I think\nyou're seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.The Lever of TechnologyWill technology increase the gap between rich and poor?  It will\ncertainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.\nThat's the whole point of technology.   With a tractor an energetic\nfarmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with\na team of horses.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  In\nhigh school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at\nBaskin-Robbins.  This was the only kind of work available at the\ntime.  Now high school kids could write software or design web\nsites.  But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping\nice cream.I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it\npossible for me to buy a computer of my own.  Within months I was\nusing it to make money as a freelance programmer.  A few years\nbefore, I couldn't have done this.  A few years before, there was\nno such thing as a freelance programmer.  But Apple created\nwealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmers\nimmediately set to work using it to create more.As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases\nour productive capacity is probably exponential, rather than linear.\nSo we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual\nproductivity as time goes on.   Will that increase the gap between\nrich and the poor?  Depends which gap you mean.Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to\ndecrease other gaps.  A hundred years ago, the rich led a different\nkind of life from ordinary people.  They lived in houses\nfull of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and\ntravelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves\nrequired their own houses and servants.  Now, thanks to technology,\nthe rich live more like the average person.Cars are a good example of why.  It's possible to buy expensive,\nhandmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But there\nis not much point.  Companies make more money by building a large\nnumber of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones.  So\na company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more\non its design.  If you buy a custom-made car, something will always\nbe breaking.  The only point of buying one now is to advertise that\nyou can.Or consider watches.  Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money\non a watch you could get better performance.  When watches had\nmechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time.  Not any\nmore.  Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex\nis more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands\nof dollars.\n[13]\nIndeed, as with expensive cars, if you're determined\nto spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some\ninconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical\nwatches have to be wound.The only thing technology can't cheapen is brand.  Which is precisely\nwhy we hear ever more about it.  Brand is the residue left as the\nsubstantive differences between rich and poor evaporate.  But what\nlabel you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having\nit versus not having it.  In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one\nasked what year or brand it was.  If you had one, you were rich.\nAnd if you weren't rich, you took the omnibus or walked.  Now even\nthe poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we're so\nwell trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially\nexpensive ones.\n[14]The same pattern has played out in industry after industry.  If\nthere is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap\nenough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions\nwill be, if not better, at least more convenient.\n[15]\nAnd there\nis nothing the rich like more than convenience.  The rich people I\nknow drive the same cars, wear the same clothes, have the same kind\nof furniture, and eat the same foods as my other friends.  Their\nhouses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood\nare different sizes, but within them life is similar.  The houses\nare made using the same construction techniques and contain much\nthe same objects.  It's inconvenient to do something expensive and\ncustom.The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  Bertie\nWooster seems long gone.  Now, most people who are rich enough not\nto work do anyway.  It's not just social pressure that makes them;\nidleness is lonely and demoralizing.Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years\nago.   The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read now\nlike descriptions of some strange tribal society.  \"With respect\nto the continuance of friendships...\" hints Mrs. Beeton's Book\nof Household Management (1880), \"it may be found necessary, in\nsome cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility\nof a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her\nlife.\" A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends\nwho didn't.  You'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.\nYou'd also have a very boring life.  People still tend to segregate\nthemselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education than\nwealth.\n[16]Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor, not increasing it.  If Lenin walked\naround the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he'd\nthink communism had won.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes,\nhave the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same\nfurnishings, and address one another by their first names instead\nof by honorifics.  Everything would seem exactly as he'd predicted,\nuntil he looked at their bank accounts.  Oops.Is it a problem if technology increases that gap?  It doesn't seem\nto be so far.  As it increases the gap in income, it seems to\ndecrease most other gaps.Alternative to an AxiomOne often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would\nincrease the income gap between rich and poor.  As if it were an\naxiom that this would be bad.  It might be true that increased\nvariation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say\nit's axiomatic.Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  In a\nsociety of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a\nsign of an underlying problem.  But serfdom is not the only cause\nof variation in income.  A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much\nas a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her\nin thrall.  His skills are simply much more valuable.I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society,\nincreasing variation in income is a sign of health.  Technology\nseems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than\nlinear rates.  If we don't see corresponding variation in income,\nthere are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation\nhas stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth\naren't doing it, or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it.I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad.  If you\ndisagree, try living for a year using only the resources available\nto the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us.\n(I'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous\nsociety without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c),\nthat people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.\nThat Jobs and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20-hour\ndays to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them,\nafter taxes, to keep just enough of their income to match what they\nwould have made working 9 to 5 at a big company.Will people create wealth if they can't get paid for it?  Only if\nit's fun.  People will write operating systems for free.  But they\nwon't install them, or take support calls, or train customers to\nuse them.  And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech\ncompanies do is of this second, unedifying kind.All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society\nthat confiscates private fortunes.  We can confirm this empirically.\nSuppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a\nnearby fan.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  You turn\nthe fan back on, and the noise starts again.  Off, quiet.  On,\nnoise.  In the absence of other information, it would seem the noise\nis caused by the fan.At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate\na fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off.  Northern\nItaly in 800, off (warlords would steal it).  Northern Italy in\n1100, on.  Central France in 1100, off (still feudal).  England in\n1800, on.  England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income).\nUnited States in 1974, on.  We've even had a twin study: West\nGermany, on;  East Germany, off.  In every case, the creation of\nwealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you\nswitch on and off the prospect of keeping it.There is some momentum involved.  It probably takes at least a\ngeneration to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).\nBut if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra\nbaggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one\nwould have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private\nfortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as\nsome modern governments have done, the result always seems to be\nthe same.    Society as a whole ends up poorer.If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially\nmuch better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one\nwhere I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I'd take\nthe first option.  If I had children, it would arguably be immoral\nnot to.  It's absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative\npoverty.  If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one\nor the other in your society, take relative poverty.You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending\ntheir money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do\nto get rich.  I'm not talking about the trickle-down effect\nhere.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll\nhire you as a waiter at his next party.  I'm saying that he'll make\nyou a tractor to replace your horse.Notes[1]\nPart of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some\nof those most vocal on the subject of wealth—university\nstudents, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalists—have\nthe least experience creating it.  (This phenomenon will be familiar\nto anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped\nto think about where that money comes from.  Heirs will be on the\nparental dole for life.  Professors and politicians live within\nsocialist eddies of the economy, at one remove from the creation\nof wealth, and are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they\nwork.  And journalists as part of their professional code segregate\nthemselves from the revenue-collecting half of the businesses they\nwork for (the ad sales department).  Many of these people never\ncome face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents\nwealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone\nelse created earlier.  They live in a world in which income is\ndoled out by a central authority according to some abstract notion\nof fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather than given\nby other people in return for something they wanted, so it may seem\nto them unfair that things don't work the same in the rest of the\neconomy.(Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for\nsociety.  But the money they're paid isn't a quid pro quo.\nIt's more in the nature of an investment.)[2]\nWhen one reads about the origins of the Fabian Society, it\nsounds like something cooked up by the high-minded Edwardian\nchild-heroes of Edith Nesbit's The Wouldbegoods.[3]\nAccording to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total\ncompensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise\nof stock options, of S&P 500 CEOs in 2002 was $3.65 million.\nAccording to Sports Illustrated, the average NBA player's\nsalary during the 2002-03 season was $4.54 million, and the average\nmajor league baseball player's salary at the start of the 2003\nseason was $2.56 million.  According to the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.[4]\nIn the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems\nto have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. Horace, Sat. ii.7.43).\nA servant girl cost 600 (Martial vi.66), while Columella (iii.3.8)\nsays that a skilled vine-dresser was worth 8,000.  A doctor, P.\nDecimus Eros Merula, paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom (Dessau,\nInscriptiones 7812).  Seneca (Ep. xxvii.7) reports\nthat one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000 sestertii apiece for slaves\nlearned in the Greek classics.  Pliny (Hist. Nat. vii.39)\nsays that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was\n700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis,\nbut that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own\nfreedom.Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices.  An ordinary\nlaborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae.  Xenophon (Mem.\nii.5) mentions prices ranging from 50 to 6,000 drachmae (for the\nmanager of a silver mine).For more on the economics of ancient slavery see:Jones, A. H. M., \"Slavery in the Ancient World,\" Economic History\nReview, 2:9 (1956), 185-199, reprinted in Finley, M. I. (ed.),\nSlavery in Classical Antiquity, Heffer, 1964.[5]\nEratosthenes (276—195 BC) used shadow lengths in different\ncities to estimate the Earth's circumference.  He was off by only\nabout 2%.[6]\nNo, and Windows, respectively.[7]\nOne of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and\nreality is the valuation of hard work.  In the Daddy Model, hard\nwork is in itself deserving.  In reality, wealth is measured by\nwhat one delivers, not how much effort it costs.  If I paint someone's\nhouse, the owner shouldn't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy\nModel that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn't get\npaid much.  To help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else\nand put our worker on a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit.\nIf he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much\nfood.  Is this unfair?  Who is being unfair to him?[8]\nPart of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be\nthe dual meaning of \"distribution.\" When economists talk about\n\"distribution of income,\" they mean statistical distribution.  But\nwhen you use the phrase frequently, you can't help associating it\nwith the other sense of the word (as in e.g. \"distribution of alms\"),\nand thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows\nfrom some central tap.  The word \"regressive\" as applied to tax\nrates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything\nregressive be good?[9]\n\"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous\ncourtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.\nIn 1525 he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom\nof Rutland.  In the thirties his support of the breach with Rome,\nhis zeal in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to\nvote the death-penalty in the succession of spectacular treason\ntrials that punctuated Henry's erratic matrimonial progress made\nhim an obvious candidate for grants of monastic property.\"Stone, Lawrence, Family and Fortune: Studies in Aristocratic\nFinance in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1973, p. 166.[10]\nThere is archaeological evidence for large settlements earlier,\nbut it's hard to say what was happening in them.Hodges, Richard and David Whitehouse, Mohammed, Charlemagne and\nthe Origins of Europe, Cornell University Press, 1983.[11]\nWilliam Cecil and his son Robert were each in turn the most\npowerful minister of the crown, and both used their position to\namass fortunes among the largest of their times.  Robert in particular\ntook bribery to the point of treason.  \"As Secretary of State and\nthe leading advisor to King James on foreign policy, [he] was a\nspecial recipient of favour, being offered large bribes by the Dutch\nnot to make peace with Spain, and large bribes by Spain to make\npeace.\" (Stone, op. cit., p. 17.)[12]\nThough Balzac made a lot of money from writing, he was notoriously\nimprovident and was troubled by debts all his life.[13]\nA Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day.  The most\naccurate mechanical watch, the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon,\nis rated at -1.5 to +2 seconds.  Its retail price is about $220,000.[14]\nIf asked to choose which was more expensive, a well-preserved\n1989 Lincoln Town Car ten-passenger limousine ($5,000) or a 2004\nMercedes S600 sedan ($122,000), the average Edwardian might well\nguess wrong.[15]\nTo say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to\ntalk about real income, or income as measured in what it can buy.\nBut the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the\ngrowth in wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price\nindex created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are\nonly locally accurate, and that don't include the prices of new\ninventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize.So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world\nwith antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than\nwithout, real income statistics calculated in the usual way will\nprove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things.Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the\nyear x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade\ngoods to make your fortune?  For example, if you were going back\nto 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing\npower you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least\n$150 million in 1970.  The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly,\nbecause for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you\nneeded in present-day trash.  In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle\nwith a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.[16]\nSome will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich\nhave better opportunities for education.  That's a valid point.  It\nis still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids' way into top\ncolleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the\ncollege admissions process.According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education\nStatistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian\nschools.  At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such\nschools.  (Interestingly, the number at Harvard is significantly\nlower, about 28%.)  Obviously this is a huge loophole.  It does at\nleast seem to be closing, not widening.Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson\nfrom the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming\nthat their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it\nis.April 2012A palliative care nurse called Bronnie Ware made a list of the\nbiggest regrets\nof the dying.  Her list seems plausible.  I could see\nmyself — can see myself — making at least 4 of these\n5 mistakes.If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might\nbe: don't be a cog.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial\nman, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances,\nthen turns dutifully till he stops.The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are\nall errors of omission.  You forget your dreams, ignore your family,\nsuppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be\nhappy.  Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of\nmistake, because you make them by default.I would like to avoid making these mistakes.  But how do you avoid\nmistakes you make by default?  Ideally you transform your life so\nit has other defaults.  But it may not be possible to do that\ncompletely. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably\nhave to be reminded not to make them.  So I inverted the 5 regrets,\nyielding a list of 5 commands\n\n   Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you\n   think; cultivate friendships; be happy.\n\nwhich I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2004(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004.)\nA few months ago I finished a new \nbook, \nand in reviews I keep\nnoticing words like \"provocative'' and \"controversial.'' To say\nnothing of \"idiotic.''I didn't mean to make the book controversial.  I was trying to make\nit efficient.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them\nthings they already knew.  It's more efficient just to give them\nthe diffs.  But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.EdisonsThere's no controversy about which idea is most controversial:\nthe suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a\nproblem as we think.I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a\ngood thing.  I said in some situations it might be a sign of good\nthings.  A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can be\na sign of a good thing-- for example, that you're recovering\nconsciousness after being hit on the head.Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity.\n(In a society of one, they're identical.) And that\nis almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation\nin productivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas\nEdison.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.\nIf you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, how\nmuch more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than\nthe worst?  A factor of two?  Whereas when you hand people a complex tool\nlike a computer, the variation in what they can do with\nit is enormous.That's not a new idea.  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and\nthe study he quoted was published in 1968.  But I think he\nunderestimated the variation between programmers.  He wrote about productivity in lines\nof code:  the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth\nthe time.  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as\nin many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding\nwhat problems to solve.  Imagination is hard to measure, but\nin practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured\nin lines of code.Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it\nvaries so much.  The variation between programmers\nis so great that it becomes a difference in kind.  I don't\nthink this is something intrinsic to programming, though.  In every field,\ntechnology magnifies differences in productivity.  I think what's\nhappening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological\nleverage.  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the\nvariation we see is something that more and more fields will see\nas time goes on.  And the success of companies, and countries, will\ndepend increasingly on how they deal with it.If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the\ncontribution of the most productive individuals will not only be\ndisproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  When\nyou reach the point where 90% of a group's output is created by 1%\nof its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids,\nor central planning) drags their productivity down to the average.If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these\nespecially productive people.  What motivates them?  What do they\nneed to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you\nget them to come and work for you?  And then of course there's the\nquestion, how do you become one?More than MoneyI know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about\nwhat they have in common.  Their defining quality is probably that\nthey really love to program.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay\nthe bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,\nand which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.\nThis isn't quite true.  It is true that all they really care about\nis doing interesting work.  But if you make enough money, you get\nto work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are\nattracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.\nBut as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they\ncare more about what they do there than how much they get paid for\nit.Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because\nit means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what\nthey're worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times\nas productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky\nto get paid three times as much.  As I'll explain later, this is\npartly because great hackers don't know how good they are.  But\nit's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.\nIn fact, that's an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable\nto use bad tools.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with\nthe wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our\nbulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,\nand the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise\nit.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're\nnot just making a technical decision.  You're also making a social\ndecision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For\nexample, if your company wants to write some software, it might\nseem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a\nlanguage, you're also choosing a community.  The programmers you'll\nbe able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as\nsmart as the\nones you could get to work on a project written in Python.\nAnd the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the\nlanguage you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers\nprefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative\nmerits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view\nlanguages as standards. They don't want to bet the company on\nBetamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not\njust standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by all\nmeans use TCP\/IP.  But a programming language isn't just a format.\nA programming language is a medium of expression.I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular\nlanguage.  As a standard, you couldn't wish for more.  But as a\nmedium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the great\nprogrammers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily\nprogram in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think of\nwho don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.\nNot just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.\nGood hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them\ngood hackers:  when something's broken, they need to fix it.  You\nwant them to feel this way about the software they're writing for\nyou.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about\nthe operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new\nstartup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next\ntime I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software\non Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer\nto be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,\nthese guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate\nhacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have\nhad to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine\na great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have\na hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had\nto be built on NT. [2]The Final FrontierAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably\nhis office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express\nrank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they\nuse their office as a place to think in.  And if you're a technology\ncompany, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers work\nin a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory\nwhere the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with\ngood reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospect\nof being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on\nhard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office with\ncubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or\nlate or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  Don't companies\nrealize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office\nenvironment is supposed to be something that helps\nyou work, not something you work despite.Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,\neven the CEO.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously\nthey still view office space as a badge of rank.  Note too that\nCisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.\nThey get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where\npresumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.\nI once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a\ndoor.  Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to\nwork where you can actually get work done.   And you know, Microsoft\nis remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop\nsoftware in house.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at\nwhat they do at home.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves\nso they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackers\ndon't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  They\nwork in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere\nto walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass\nboxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can take\na nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at\ntheir desk, pretending to work.  There's no crew of people with\nvacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime\nhacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate\nretreats or team-building exercises.  And when you look at what\nthey're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I\nsaid earlier about tools.  They may have to use Java and Windows\nat work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're\nmore likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular\nlanguage can be misleading.  What we ought to look at, if we want\nto know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can\nchoose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  When you ask\nthat question, you find that open source operating systems already\nhave a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably\nPerl.InterestingAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.  What\nmakes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy\napplications like stealth planes or special effects software would\nbe interesting to work on.  But any application can be interesting\nif it poses novel technical challenges.  So it's hard to predict\nwhich problems hackers will like, because some become\ninteresting only when the people working on them discover a new\nkind of solution.  Before ITA\n(who wrote the software inside Orbitz),\nthe people working on airline fare searches probably thought it\nwas one of the most boring applications imaginable.  But ITA made\nit interesting by \nredefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google.  When Google was founded,\nthe conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search\nwas boring and unimportant.  But the guys at Google didn't think\nsearch was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.  Like a parent\nsaying to a child, I bet you can't clean up your whole room in\nten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a\nmore interesting one.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at\nthis, in part simply by having high standards.  There were a lot\nof small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  He redefined the\nproblem as: make one that's beautiful.  And that probably drove\nthe developers harder than any carrot or stick could.They certainly delivered.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn't\neven have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell\nfrom the case.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in\nCambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac\ncarrying case.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  I carried\nit home and plugged it in, and it booted.  The happy Macintosh\nface, and then the finder.  My God, it was so simple.  It was just\nlike ... Google.Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  But it's not\nenough just to be exacting.  You have to insist on the right things.\nWhich usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.  I've\nseen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  Really\nthere should be two articles: one about what to do if\nyou are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not.  And the \nsecond could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.The problem is not so much the day to day management.  Really good\nhackers are practically self-managing.  The problem is, if you're\nnot a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are.  A similar\nproblem explains why American cars are so ugly.  I call it the\ndesign paradox.  You might think that you could make your products\nbeautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But if\nyou yourself don't have good taste, \nhow are you going to recognize\na good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.\nAnd you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs he's had,\nbecause in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by\nfashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third.\nThere's no way around it:  you can't manage a process intended to\nproduce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is.  American\ncars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with\nbad taste.Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive,\nor even frivolous.  It is neither.  To drive design, a manager must\nbe the most demanding user of a company's products.  And if you\nhave really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying\nyou the kind of problem that good people like to work on.Nasty Little ProblemsIt's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting:\nthose where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have\nto solve a lot of nasty little ones.  One of the worst kinds of\nprojects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's\nfull of bugs.  Another is when you have to customize\nsomething for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs.\nTo hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand\ncuts.The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you\ndon't learn anything from them.   Writing a compiler is interesting\nbecause it teaches you what a compiler is.  But writing an interface\nto a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the\nbugs are random.  [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good\nhackers avoid nasty little problems.  It's more a question of\nself-preservation.  Working on nasty little problems makes you\nstupid.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid\ncheeseburgers.Of course some problems inherently have this character.  And because\nof supply and demand, they pay especially well.  So a company that\nfound a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would\nbe very successful.  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  At our startup we had \nRobert Morris working as a system administrator.  That's like having the\nRolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You can't hire that kind of\ntalent.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies\nof which they're the founders.  [4]Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.\nThey get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate\nR&D department where employees don't have to work directly on\ncustomers' nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the research\ndepartment functions like a mine. They produce new ideas; maybe\nthe rest of the company will be able to use them.You may not have to go to this extreme.  \nBottom-up programming\nsuggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people\nwork as toolmakers.  If your company makes software to do x, have\none group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and\nanother that uses these tools to write the applications.  This way\nyou might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code,\nbut still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would\nbe in a traditional research department.  The toolmakers would have\nusers, but they'd only be the company's own developers.  [6]If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full\nof security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual\napplications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating\nmemory.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging\ntogether big Lego blocks of Word-language.  (Duplo, I believe, is\nthe technical term.)ClumpingAlong with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other\ngood hackers.  Great hackers tend to clump together-- sometimes\nspectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc.   So you won't attract good\nhackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create\nfor them.  The tendency to clump means it's more like the square\nof the environment.  So it's winner take all.  At any given time,\nthere are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to\nwork, and if you aren't one of them, you won't just have fewer\ngreat hackers, you'll have zero.Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company\nsuccessful.  It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of\nthe hot spots right now, but it didn't help Thinking Machines or\nXerox.  Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model\nis a down elevator.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't\nsave you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that\ncan attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.  There are\npeople who would disagree with this.  When we were making the rounds\nof venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software\ncompanies didn't win by writing great software, but through brand,\nand dominating channels, and doing the right deals.They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.  I\nthink what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously,\nis the next Microsoft.  And of course if Microsoft is your model,\nyou shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing\ngreat software.  But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft,\nbecause no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other\ncompany is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be\nthe next IBM.It's a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole\nculture derives from that one lucky break.  Microsoft is a bad data\npoint.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend\nto win in the market.  What VCs should be looking for is the next\nApple, or the next Google.I think Bill Gates knows this.  What worries him about Google is\nnot the power of their brand, but the fact that they have\nbetter hackers. [7]\nRecognitionSo who are the great hackers?  How do you know when you meet one?\nThat turns out to be very hard.  Even hackers can't tell.  I'm\npretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker.\nYou may have read on Slashdot how he made his \nown Segway.  The\nremarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the\nsoftware in one day (in Python, incidentally).For Trevor, that's\npar for the course.  But when I first met him, I thought he was a\ncomplete idiot.  He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling\nat him about something or other, and I remember standing behind\nhim making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his\noffice so we could go to lunch.  Robert says he misjudged Trevor\nat first too.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had\njust begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about\nevery aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried\nwith him everywhere.  He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had\na strong Canadian accent and a mullet.The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their\nreputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of\neffort into seeming smart.  When I was in grad school I used to\nhang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. It was kind of intimidating\nat first.  Everyone there spoke so fast.  But after a while I\nlearned the trick of speaking fast.  You don't have to think any\nfaster; just use twice as many words to say everything.  With this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good\nhackers when you meet them.  I can't tell, even now.  You also\ncan't tell from their resumes.  It seems like the only way to judge\na hacker is to work with him on something.And this is the reason that high-tech areas \nonly happen around universities.  The active ingredient\nhere is not so much the professors as the students.  Startups grow up\naround universities because universities bring together promising young\npeople and make them work on the same projects.  The\nsmart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together\nthey cook up new projects of their own.Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him,\nhackers themselves can't tell how good they are.  This is true to\na degree in most fields.  I've found that people who\nare great at something are not so much convinced of their own\ngreatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.\nBut it's particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are,\nbecause it's hard to compare their work.  This is easier in most\nother fields.  In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who's\nfastest.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about\nwhich problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good\nsolution.  But hacking is like writing.  Who can say which of two\nnovels is better?  Certainly not the authors.With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell.  That's because,\nunlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  When you get\nto hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn\npretty quickly how hard they hit them back.  But hackers can't\nwatch themselves at work.  So if you ask a great hacker how good\nhe is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know.  He's not just\nbeing modest.  He really doesn't know.And none of us know, except about people we've actually worked\nwith.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don't know who our\nheroes should be.  The hackers who become famous tend to become\nfamous by random accidents of PR.  Occasionally I need to give an\nexample of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.  The first\nnames that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally,\nbut it seems lame to use them.  So, I think, maybe I should say\nRichard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famous\nlike that.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.\nI've never worked with them on anything.If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including\nhim.CultivationFinally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about:\nhow do you become a great hacker?  I don't know if it's possible\nto make yourself into one.  But it's certainly possible to do things\nthat make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you\ncan probably make yourself smart too.The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.\nWhen I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have\nin common is the extreme \ndifficulty of making them work \non anything they\ndon't want to.  I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be\nboth.To do something well you have to love it.  \nSo to the extent you\ncan preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it\nwell.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at\nage 14.  If you're worried that your current job is rotting your\nbrain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in\na lot of fields.  Is there some quality that's unique to hackers?\nI asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was\ncuriosity.  \nI'd always supposed that all smart people were curious--\nthat curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge.  But\napparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how\nthings work.  That makes sense, because programs are in effect\ngiant descriptions of how things work.Several friends mentioned hackers' ability to concentrate-- their\nability, as one put it, to \"tune out everything outside their own\nheads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  And I've heard several \nhackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at\nall.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.\nPerhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their\nhead, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just\nthat line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee\nwrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due\npartly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  \"Perfect'' eyesight\nmeans about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley\nhad 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.\nMaybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by\nusing a very dense language, \nwhich shrinks the court.)This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the people\nin charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,\nhave no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having\none's brain in a blender.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism\nare true, knows all too well.)One difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people\nin general is that hackers are more \npolitically incorrect.  To the\nextent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they\nknow one another well enough to express opinions that would get\nthem stoned to death by the general public.  And I can see why\npolitical incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.\nPrograms are very complex and, at least in the hands of good\nprogrammers, very fluid.  In such situations it's helpful to have\na habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  But you can at\nleast not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If\nit is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do\nit may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have\nto work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),\nand in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.\nAll the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though\nperhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes\n[1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  I\nwrote this on an IBM laptop.[2] They did turn out to be doomed.  They shut down a few months\nlater.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk\nabout the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an \nodd idea.  Life isn't an expression; how could it have meaning?\nBut it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning.  In a project\nlike a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems\nall fall into a pattern, as in a signal.  Whereas when the problems\nyou have to solve are random, they seem like noise.\n[4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators. (He had equity.)[5] It's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the\ncomputer world, but as a first approximation, it's software that\ndoesn't have users.I don't think it's publication that makes the best hackers want to work\nin research departments.  I think it's mainly not having to have a\nthree hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating\nthe Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip.[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the\nconstruction industry. When you had a house built a couple hundred\nyears ago, the local builders built everything in it.  But increasingly\nwhat builders do is assemble components designed and manufactured\nby someone else.  This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing,\ngiven people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it\nis certainly more efficient.[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was.\nProbably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  Not\nleast because they're determined to fight.  On their job listing\npage, they say that one of their \"core values'' is \"Don't be evil.''\nFrom a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a\nstatement would merely be eccentric.  But I think all of us in the\ncomputer world recognize who that is a declaration of war on.Thanks to Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Sarah Harlin\nfor reading earlier versions of this talk.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nOctober 2010After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding\nbusiness is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called\nturmoil.  At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding\nenvironment for startups.  Fortunately one of them is much higher\nvaluations.The trends we've been seeing are probably not YC-specific.  I wish\nI could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we\nsee trends first—partly because the startups we fund are very\nplugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything\nnew, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data\npoints to see patterns clearly.What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in\nthe next couple years.  So I'm going to explain what we're seeing,\nand what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.Super-AngelsLet me start by describing what the world of startup funding used\nto look like.  There used to be two sharply differentiated types\nof investors: angels and venture capitalists.  Angels are individual\nrich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs\nare employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's.For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now\na third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called\nsuper-angels. \n[1]\n  And VCs have been provoked by their arrival\ninto making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.  So the\npreviously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly\nblurred.There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs.  Angels\nwould invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more.\nSo an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that\ncombined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in\nwhich a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient\none for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted\nto raise.  Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise\naround $400k.  But it was a pain to stitch together that much out\nof angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments\nso small.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have\nappeared.  They're responding to the market.The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups,\nbecause there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one\nanother.  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs.  That's\ngoing to change the rules about how to raise money.  I don't know\nyet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes\nwill be for the better.A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of\nthe qualities of a VC.  They're usually individuals, like angels.\nIn fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of\nthe classic type.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money.\nThis allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical\nsuper-angel investment is currently about $100k.  They make investment\ndecisions quickly, like angels.  And they make a lot more investments\nper partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them\ndoubly alarming to VCs. They don't just compete for startups; they\nalso compete for investors.  What super-angels really are is a new\nform of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund.   And those of us in the\ntechnology world know what usually happens when something comes\nalong that can be described in terms like that.  Usually it's the\nreplacement.Will it be?  As of now, few of the startups that take money from\nsuper-angels are ruling out taking VC money.  They're just postponing\nit.  But that's still a problem for VCs.  Some of the startups that\npostpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they\nraise that they never bother to raise more.  And those who do raise\nVC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  If\nthe best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series\nA rounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold.\n[2]So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.\nBut one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven\ndistribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are\nconcentrated in a few big successes.  The expected value of a startup\nis the percentage chance it's Google.  So to the extent that winning\nis a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically\nall the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if\nthey merely failed to get those few big winners.  And there's a\nchance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better\nbrands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.  \n[3]Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have\nless partner per investment.  They can't pay as much attention to\nyou as a VC on your board could.  How much is that extra attention\nworth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another.  There's\nno consensus yet in the general case.  So for now this is something\nstartups are deciding individually.Till now, VCs' claims about how much value they added were sort of\nlike the government's.  Maybe they made you feel better, but you\nhad no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only\nVCs could supply.  Now that VCs have competitors, that's going to\nput a market price on the help they offer.  The interesting thing\nis, no one knows yet what it will be.Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and\nconnections only the top VCs can supply?  Or would super-angel money\ndo just as well?  The VCs will say you need them, and the super-angels\nwill say you don't.  But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even\nthe VCs and super-angels themselves.   All the super-angels know\nis that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying,\nand all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worry\nabout.RoundsWhatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels is\ngood news for founders.  And not just for the obvious reason that\nmore competition for deals means better terms.  The whole shape of\ndeals is changing.One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount\nof your company they want.  VCs want a lot.  In a series A round\nthey want a third of your company, if they can get it.  They don't\ncare much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the\nnumber of series A investments they can do is so small.  In a\ntraditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC\nfund takes a seat on your board.  \n[4]\n Since board seats last about\n5 years and each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once,\nthat means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner\nper year. And that means they need to get as much of the company\nas they can in each one.  You'd have to be a very promising startup\nindeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only a\nfew percent of you.Since angels generally don't take board seats, they don't have this\nconstraint.  They're happy to buy only a few percent of you.  And\nalthough the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they've\nretained this critical property of angels.  They don't take board\nseats, so they don't need a big percentage of your company.Though that means you'll get correspondingly less attention from\nthem, it's good news in other respects.  Founders never really liked\ngiving up as much equity as VCs wanted.  It was a lot of the company\nto give up in one shot.  Most founders doing series A deals would\nprefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then\nsee what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock\nafter using the first half of the money to increase its value.  But\nVCs never offered that option.Now startups have another alternative.  Now it's easy to raise angel\nrounds about half the size of series A rounds.  Many of the startups\nwe fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of\nstartups in general.A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with\na valuation cap of $4 million premoney.  Meaning that when the note\nconverts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the\ninvestors in that round will get .6 \/ 4.6, or 13% of the company.\nThat's a lot less than the 30 to 40% of the company you usually\ngive up in a series A round if you do it so early.  \n[5]But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that\nthey cause less dilution.  You also lose less control.  After an\nangel round, the founders almost always still have control of the\ncompany, whereas after a series A round they often don't.  The\ntraditional board structure after a series A round is two founders,\ntwo VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person.  Plus series A\nterms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of\nimportant decisions, including selling the company.  Founders usually\nhave a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as things\nare going well.  But that's not the same as just being able to do\nwhat you want, like you could before.A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that\nthey're less stressful to raise.  Raising a traditional series A\nround has in the past taken weeks, if not months.  When a VC firm\ncan only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about\nwhich they do.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go\nthrough a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting\nwhere the firm as a whole says yes or no.  That's the really scary\npart for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, but\nat the end of this long process the VCs might still say no.  The\nchance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averages\nabout 25%.  At some firms it's over 50%.Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster.\nNowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months.\nBut they're still not as fast as angels and super-angels, the most\ndecisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.Raising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedback\nas it progresses.  An angel round is not an all or nothing thing\nlike a series A.  It's composed of multiple investors with varying\ndegrees of seriousness, ranging from the upstanding ones who commit\nunequivocally to the jerks who give you lines like \"come back to\nme to fill out the round.\" You usually start collecting money from\nthe most committed investors and work your way out toward the\nambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.But at each point you know how you're doing.  If investors turn\ncold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel\nround turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead\nof blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens\nif you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting.\nWhereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the round\nfaster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm,\nactually raise the price to reflect demand.ValuationHowever, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels,\nand they have started to use it.   VCs have started making angel-sized\ninvestments too.  The term \"angel round\" doesn't mean that all the\ninvestors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the\nround.  Increasingly the participants include VCs making investments\nof a hundred thousand or two.  And when VCs invest in angel rounds\nthey can do things that super-angels don't like.  VCs are quite\nvaluation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they are\nin general, and partly because they don't care that much about the\nreturns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to\nrecruit startups for series A rounds later.  So VCs who invest in\nangel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels\nwho invest in them. \n[6]Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  Several turned\ndown YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations\nwere too high.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition\na high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.\nBut it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble\nabout valuations.  Did they not understand that the big returns\ncome from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far\nmore which startups you picked than how much you paid\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n```\n        What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?
